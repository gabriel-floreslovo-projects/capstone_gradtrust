Since A0 is already analog-capable, it’s safe to reuse as a digital pin for OneWire.
So we’ll use:
A0 (D14) → Temperature sensor (OneWire)
A1 → Sound sensor envelope
A2 → Light sensor



going to output:
ENTROPY: a0b1c2...ff

main compute
pip install flask pyserial
ngrok http 5000
You’ll get a public URL like https://abc123.ngrok.io, then on Heroku, make a GET request to:
https://abc123.ngrok.io/entropy

entropy as a service 


current file runs locally by executing python3 flaskbackend.py. if serial connection busy, close arduino ide. 


ngrok http http://localhost:5050
must also be running the python backend on computer
